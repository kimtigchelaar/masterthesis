# masterthesis

This is the code for Kim Tigchelaar's master thesis that was conducted through an internship at Air France-KLM.
During my thesis, I implemented a workflow for federated RUL prediction of subsets DS01, DS04, and DS08c of the N-CMAPSS dataset. This dataset is no longer publicly available and was therefore accessed through Air France-KLM. 
For the federated setup, a Virtual Environment needs to be created that contains the specific requirements provided in the “requirements.txt”. Four separate terminals have to be opened, one for running the “server.py” file and three for running client files 1, 2, and 3.
